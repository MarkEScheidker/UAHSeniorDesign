# UAH Senior Design

# What is this?
## This is the code repositroy for our senior design project, which will include the html code for both a website, and the backend server code that makes it run.

# What does it do?
## At the moment, it does noting, and there is no code. Over the course of the next year, we will be designing all of the necessary componenents to build a full website that behaves like a remote food ordering service.

# What will the final product look like?
## We plan to allow new users to create accounts with an email and password. Passwords should be stored securely using hashing, and passwords should be reset through email verification. Users should be able to order food at a specific restaurant and "pay" with a credit card, which will also be handled securely. Restaurant specific accounts can also be created, and allow restaurants to see customer's orders in a queue, as well as mark when specific orders are complete, alerting the user to the status of their order. Security will be one of the top priorities, and customer data will be handled safely, and the database should be protected from SQL injections as well as other conventional attacks. All of this will be handled on a single server, and hosted on a website for simplicity.
